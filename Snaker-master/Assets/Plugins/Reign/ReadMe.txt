----------------------------
Getting Started
----------------------------
Open one of the scenes from: "Assets/Plugins/DemoScenes/...".
And look at ".cs" files for reference.
Make sure you have the "Assets/Plugins/Reign/Services/ReignServices.prefab" in the Scene for the plugins to work.

Post build steps
----------------------------
Look at "http://www.reign-studios.net/docs/" for potential post build steps required for particular platforms.

----------------------------
Updating
----------------------------
If you have multiple Reign Unity Plugins its a good idea to check and make sure there versions are in sync via "Edit->Reign->Validate plugin versions are in Sync".
If they are not or you are having issues:
1) Download a up to date package via: "Edit->Reign->Download UnityPackage Updates".
2) Delete all Reign Plugin files.
3) Re-Install the Reign Unity Plugin package.
